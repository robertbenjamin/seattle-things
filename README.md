# Seattle Things (Temporary Name)

Your go-to bucketlist for things to do in Seattle.

## Plan

- Build basic static version (straight up HTML / JS), share it some places, get feedback and rebuild in Angular (or other framework)
- In the new version, make some kind of basic API so you can add entries easily and the user can sort / search within entries.

## Ideas

- Include map / location?
- Include image or go text-based?
- Have icons or categories? (Food, Fun, Outdoors)
- SPA or static?
- Row-based or something with flexbox?
- Allow for users to submit suggestions?
